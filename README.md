Abstract: I have Developed Software Package that Can Monitor Industrial Processes and Control Industrial Tasks. 
The Development of This Software Package Has Taken 8 Months to #date. 
This Software Package Has a lot of Ability. For Instance, You Can Communicate With Your Industrial Device By USART-RS232, MODBU, OPC UA, And PROFINET. 
IF you want Get Further Information Read This README File.

Main Environment
