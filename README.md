Abstract: I have Developed Software Package that Can Monitor Industrial Processes and Control Industrial Tasks. The Development of This Software Package Has Taken 30 Months to date. This Software Package Has many Ability. For Instance, You Can Communicate With Industrial Devices By USART RS232,MODBU, OPC UA, PROFINET And MQTT protocols. also you can Control three-Axis CNC's. IF you want Get Further Information Read This README File.

Main Environment

If any Problem Happen. Software Automatically Establish Record In Database. Moreover, If Problem has Very High Hazard, Software Plays Siren.

After Back to Normal Situation, Supervisor And inspector can Check Condition Happened by Click Get Report Icon.

Get Report from Main Environment or Event Icon in Menu Bar:

MODBUS Design Workbench:

if you click on Generate button you see on your design workbench some textboxes. before that you must choose your range of your registers you want, by combobox if you choose 0, your range include entire of registers that active on your modbus network. textboxes which generated by your choice. have been linked to modbus registers, and you can recieve value of your registers realtime.then you can click on industrial symbols and draw them on your design workbench.

For This Software Package, I Developed Internal DSL You can Monitor Your Processes with Commands.

First Internal DSL:
